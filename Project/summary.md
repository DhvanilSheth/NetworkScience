# Project Summary: Enhanced Community Detection Algorithm

## What we've built

We've developed a comprehensive system for enhanced community detection in networks with the following components:

### Core Functionality
1. **Enhanced Community Detection Algorithm**
   - Improves upon Greedy Modularity Optimization
   - Uses local clustering coefficient and internal connectivity metrics
   - Identifies and reassigns misfit nodes to better communities

2. **Utilities and Support Functions**
   - Network loading and preprocessing utilities
   - Synthetic data generation
   - Metrics for algorithm evaluation

3. **User Interfaces**
   - Interactive Streamlit web application
   - Command-line interface for batch processing
   - Python library API for integration into other projects

### Documentation
1. **Algorithm description and methodology**
2. **Usage guides for various interfaces**
3. **Examples and demonstration notebooks**

### Evaluation Framework
1. **Comparison with other community detection algorithms**
2. **Performance metrics and visualization tools**
3. **Tests on synthetic networks with known community structure**

## Using the Project

1. **For Basic Users**:
   - Run the Streamlit app for interactive exploration:
     ```
     streamlit run src/app.py
     ```

2. **For Batch Processing**:
   - Use the command-line interface:
     ```
     python src/run_detection.py --input <network_file> --output <results_dir>
     ```

3. **For Integration into Other Projects**:
   - Import and use the Python library:
     ```python
     from src.enhanced_community_detection import EnhancedCommunityDetection
     ```

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further development:

1. Optimization for very large networks
2. Adding more advanced visualization options
3. Implementing additional comparison metrics
4. Integration with other network analysis tools
5. Support for directed and weighted networks
6. Dynamic community detection for temporal networks
